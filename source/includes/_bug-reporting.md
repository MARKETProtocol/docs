## What's GitHub?

GitHub is a version control system, a place where developers store their code. And it's the place where our community publicly stores all our applications.

GitHub allows groups of developers to collaborate on the same documents (often source code) simultaneously and without overriding each otherâ€™s work.

## Security Issues

The MARKET Protocol and its implementations are still in early development, which means there may be problems with the
protocol or in our implementations. We take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you discover a security issue,
please bring it to our attention right away!

If you find a vulnerability please send your report privately to [support@marketprotocol.io](mailto:support@marketprotocol.io) Please DO NOT file a public issue.

If the issue is a protocol weakness or something not yet deployed, feel free to discuss it openly.
